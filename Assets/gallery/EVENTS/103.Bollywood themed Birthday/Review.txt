Many thanks Eventz N Trendz for all your support and help in making my mum’s 60th birthday party a night full of celebration and lovely memories.

We were keen to have a themed event, which seemed a great idea in our heads and when browsing Pinterest, yet incredibly daunting on execution. We contacted Eventz N Trendz just about a month prior to the event, and with just a couple of brief meetings and phone conversations, they put together the entire event beautifully, with absolute minimal hassle for us. We handled just one component of the event directly (not at all sure why we did in retrospect) and realized what saviors these guys really were!

Even on the night of the event, Uzmaan and Iyanthie coordinated the flow of it very smoothly, so we had all the time to actually enjoy the event as opposed to being tied down with host tasks and chores.

They were very pleasant to work with and just great at what they do. Fantastic execution maintaining a surreal sense of calm throughout!

Until the next event we work together…wishing you all the best!
