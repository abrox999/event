Saliya & I got married on the 30th of July this year but our preparations began soon after Saliya "popped the question".
We wanted a simple wedding and were quite well organised, so one could only imagine our horror when my mother in law announced that she had hired Eventz N Trendz as our wedding planners!
We had met all our suppliers and finalized plans but I must say Uzmaan & Iyanthie did a wonderful job on the day making sure everything went smoothly to plan and we along with our parents were able to enjoy our wedding, relatively stress free.
I feel this testimonial would not be complete without the mention of Uzmaan going out of his way to collect the flower for Saliya's coat from the florist before he got to church as this was left behind by the florist. Iyanthie, thank you for your assistance in choosing the sparkling wine and keeping our little attendants in place!!!!
This is a sincere heartfelt THANK YOU from a couple who didn't want you at their wedding, but are glad that you were, because you guys did a fantastic job in making our wedding day an amazing one that everyone who attended still talk about.
Its the little things that both of you did on the day that made the greatest impact. Thanks again and we wish you all the best as you continue to bring every Bride's dream of a fairytale wedding come true!!!
