First of all I would like to thank both Uzmaan & Iyanthie. Your work is amazing. Me and Vageesha were stress free on the wedding day. 3rd of July is the best day of my life and you both coordinated it so well.
First I was in doubt whether I should go for a planner but when I got you and worked with you both, I knew my decision was correct. Believe me, on my big day I was actually not stressed at all and throughout the day, from morning I enjoyed every second of it. Also you both got a good selection of suppliers. I was unable to concentrate on all the meetings because of my work schedules and sometimes I forgot the meetings as well, but you were always patient and reminded me on everything. Everyone who came on the day told us it was an excellent work. It is because of you guys. Once again thanks a lot.
Also for the couples who are planning their weddings in future, I strongly recommend to choose Eventz N Trendz as their event planner. You can be stress free and enjoy your wedding.
