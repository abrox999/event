Planning a wedding is not an easy task but thanks to Iyanthie and Uzmaan our wedding was just perfect as we always wanted it to be.

Both of them were very helpful in guiding us throughout the process of planning our big day, be it the very first discussions or arranging meetings with our service providers. On the day of the wedding they gave attention to every minute detail so that the whole function was running smoothly without any delays or gaps. We got so many complements about the flow of the function.

Thank you very much Eventz N Trendz for putting up yet another wonderful event. We would highly recommend your wonderful service to anyone.
