A wonderful note of thanks for the incredible coordination & supervision Uzmaan & Iyanthie pulled off on our wedding day.
You guys are truly talented & did a remarkable work in spite of the fact that we only communicated through emails being abroad and finally met only 10 days before the wedding.
Every last minute meeting we went with you was pleasurable & most of all your advice & guidance on several issues was most welcome and appreciated.
By taking care of every detail on the day of the reception allowed our families & us to enjoy an awesome day. Your expertise & knowledge to handle our VIP guests was greatly valued by us all.
Sulanga & I simply want to THANK YOU for your help & making our wedding day hassle free & most of all unforgettable. We have been truly amazed by the many complimentary calls that we received on how dazzling the wedding was.
A little note to Iyanthie with whom my Sister & I had a wonderful time during our interview with Subasiri . Her refreshing & easy going personality made us calm & relaxed.
We find words inappropriate to describe our appreciation & your way of working with people is unique & precious in todayâ€™s world.
Thank you both once again for making our day beautiful, so joyous & stress free.
