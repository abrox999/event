Whenever we talk about the wedding, you guys never fail to get a mention. We would have been lost without you both that day. Everything went so perfectly because you guys saw to it all and made sure the day ran smoothly. Both of us, as well as our parents are so grateful to you both and will recommend you to everyone we know. Thank you so much!
