Yoshan & I are evermore grateful for the wonderful job that you two pulled off in making our wedding, picture perfect.
From the moment we decided to engage your day coordination services at the eleventh hour, your professionalism, enthusiasm & your thoughtfulness exceeded all our expectations, so much so that we regret not hiring you earlier.
We truly appreciate the effort you put in, working tirelessly to make our wedding day all that we wanted it to be and more.
A very big thank you, with all our loveâ€¦
