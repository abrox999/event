We wanted to say a BIG thank you for all you two did to make our wedding the best day of our lives! We had an awesome day and none of it could have been possible without all your input, ideas, patience with the groom, understanding (especially our theme) and hard work
It was exactly how we had hoped it would be and thank you so much for making it a reality.

People could say why they need wedding planners...but those people don't understand what they are missing without them. You guys are amazing. We didn't feel any stress at all on the wedding day. If people are really looking for a stress free, happy and time to enjoy at their wedding; definitely Eventz N Trendz is the place they should consider.

You guys obviously have talents that are immeasurable...but are done with such love :-) We wish you all the very best for your future endeavors. Way to go Uzi & Iyanthie...
Keep up the good work guys!!!
